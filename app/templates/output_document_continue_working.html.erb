    <p>You can leave your pension pot untouched until you make a decision. You
      don’t pay tax on the money while it stays in the pot. By the time you’re
      ready to take the money, new pension options may be available and you
      could have more choice. </p>

    <p>You might want flexibility during your retirement. You could, for
      example, mix your options to suit your changing circumstances. Usually
      you need a larger pension pot to do this. You might also want to talk to
      a financial adviser because mixing your options can be complicated. Tips
      on finding a financial adviser are on

      <h3>Next steps</h3>

      <p>If you want to leave your pot untouched for a while, ask your
        provider the following questions: </p>

      <div class="emphasize">
        <p>What are your charges for leaving my money in longer?</p>

        <p>Do I have to take the money by a certain date?</p>

        <p>How much is the pot likely to grow each year?</p>

        <p>How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?</p>

        <p>How much can I still pay in?</p>

        <p>Does my pot have any special arrangements attached to it that could
          mean I get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain
          time?</p>

        <p>Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot
          to (my ‘beneficiary’)?</p>
