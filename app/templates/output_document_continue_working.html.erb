      <p>You can leave your pension pot
        untouched until you need the
        money. While the money stays in
        your pot you don’t pay tax on it. It’s
        up to you when you take the money
        out but the earliest is usually aged
        55. By the time you’re ready to take
        the money, new pension options
        may be available and you could
        have more choice. </p>

      <p>You can also still pay into your
        pension pot but there are
        restrictions on how much tax relief
        you get on these payments. If you’re
        an employee your employer might
        continue to make contributions too.

          <p>Ask your provider the following

            <p>What are your charges for leaving my money in longer?</p>

            <p>Do I have to take the money by a certain date?</p>

            <p>How much is the pot likely to grow each year?</p>

            <p>How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?</p>

            <p>How much can I still pay in?</p>

            <p>Does my pot have any special arrangements attached to it that could
              mean I get a better deal,<br />
              eg a guaranteed value at a certain time?</p>

            <p>Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot
              to (my ‘beneficiary’)?</p>
