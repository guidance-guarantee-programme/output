      <h3>Benefits and pension income</h3>

      <p>If you’re on benefits or planning to apply for means-tested benefits in
        the future, any income from your pension will be taken into account. This
        could mean that you might not be eligible for a benefit or get less
        money. </p>

      <p>Go to
        <a href="https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/benefits">pensionwise.gov.uk/benefits</a>
        for more information or contact your local Citizens Advice bureau.</p>

      <h3>Debt and pension income</h3>

      <p>If you’re planning to pay off large debt with money from your pension
        pot you should get debt advice first. If you’re worried about debt or
        budgeting issues the Money Advice Service and Citizens Advice can both help
        you. </p>

      <h3>Watch out for pension scams</h3>

      <p>A pension scam is when criminals try to cheat you out of the money in
        your pension pot. Often scammers contact you by cold calling. You should
        never let yourself be pressured into making a decision during a cold
        call. </p>
