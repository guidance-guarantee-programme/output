        You told us that you have other income in retirement, eg from a
        defined benefit (final salary) pension, savings, rental income etc. 
      </p>

      <p>Most people are entitled to the State Pension.  You can apply for a State
        Pension statement telling you how much you’ll get at

          gov.uk/state-pension-statement</a></p>

      <p>When working out how much money you’ll have in retirement you should
        take all your assets into account -

        explains how to do this.</p>

      <h3>What’s important to you in retirement</h3>

      <p>In the appointment we talked about some of the things that are
        important to you in retirement.</p>

      <p>We’ve included the main points here and how they might affect your
        pension options. However, we can’t list everything we talked about. When
        making your decision on how to take money from your pension pot you
        should consider all your circumstances. </p>

          costs as you get older.</p>
