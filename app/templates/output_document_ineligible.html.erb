  <p>In the appointment we found out that you have a defined benefit or 'final
    salary' pension. Pension Wise only provides guidance on what you can do
    with a defined contribution pension. We apologise if this wasn't made
    clear before the appointment.</p>

  <p>A defined benefit pension is a secure way to provide you with an income
    in retirement. If you have any questions about your pension you should
    contact your provider directly. You can usually find their details on your
    pension statements.</p>

  <p>You can get help with defined benefit pensions from The Pensions Advisory
    Service. Visit their website at pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk or phone
    0300 123 1047 for independent and impartial advice.</p>

  <p>Most people are eligible for the State Pension paid by the government.
    Phone 0845 600 4274 to apply for a State Pension statement to find out how
    much youâ€™ll get.</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
