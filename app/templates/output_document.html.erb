      <p>Most people are entitled to the State Pension. Find out how much State

        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-statement">
          gov.uk/state-pension-statement</a></p>

      <p>When working out how much money you’ll have in retirement you should
        take all your assets into account -
        <a href="https://pensionwise.gov.uk/work-out-income">pensionwise.gov.uk/work-out-income</a>
        explains how to do this.</p>

      <h3>What’s important to you in retirement</h3>

      <p>In the appointment we talked about some of the things that are
        important to you in retirement.</p>

      <p>We’ve included the main points here and how they might affect your
        pension options. However, we can’t list everything we talked about. When
        making your decision on how to take money from your pension pot you
        should consider all your circumstances. </p>

          <p>How much tax you’ll pay - the tax-free Personal Allowance for the
            2015/16 tax year is £10,600. </p>

          <p>How long your money needs to last - on average, people aged 55
            today will live to their mid-to-late 80s. </p>

          <p>Future costs in retirement - you may have extra health and care
            costs as you get older.
            The impact of inflation - as prices go up your pension might buy you
            less in the future. </p>

          <p>Benefits to supplement your income - use one of the benefit
            calculators on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators">

  <h2>The 5 options discussed in the appointment</h2>

  <div class="l-text-max">
    <h3>Leaving your pot untouched</h3>

    <p>You don’t have to take money from your pension straight away. You can
      leave your money invested and take it when you’re ready. You might have
      a bigger choice of pension products in the future as providers are
      coming up with new ones.</p>

    <h3>Get a guaranteed income (annuity)</h3>

    <p>This is an insurance policy you buy to give you a guaranteed income for
      the rest of your life or for a fixed number of years. You can take up
      to 25% of your pot tax free before you buy an annuity. There are
      different types of annuities and it’s important you buy the right one
      for you.</p>

    <h3>Take your money flexibly (take flexible lump sums or get a flexible
      income) </h3>

    <p>You can take your money flexibly in 2 ways. It depends what kind of
      income you want to get from your pot. You can always take 25% tax
      free.</p>

    <p><b>Take flexible lump sums:</b> Your pot stays where it is and you can
      take money out when you want to. 25% of each cash amount you take out is
      tax free, the rest is taxable. This is also known as 'uncrystallised
      fund pension lump sum' or ‘UFPLS’.</p>

    <p><b>Get a flexible income:</b> You can take 25% of your pot as a single
      tax-free cash sum. The rest of your money is invested to give you a
      regular income (this is taxable). You use a pension provider or
      financial adviser to invest your money in a way that suits your
      circumstances. This is also known as 'flexi-access drawdown'. You can
      also do flexi-access drawdown in stages.</p>

    <h3>Take your whole pot in one go</h3>

    <p>If you take your whole pension pot in one go - 25% is tax-free and the
      remaining 75% would be taxable.</p>

    <h3>Mix your options</h3>

    <p>You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options
      we talked about in the appointment.</p>

    <p class="callout">Pension Wise is an impartial government service. We
      don’t recommend any products or tell you what to do with your money.</p>

    <p class="callout">
      Whichever option you decide on ask your provider about fees and charges.
      Also make sure how much tax you pay - go to

      <p>If you buy an annuity you would have to get a ‘joint annuity’ or a
        ‘guaranteed period annuity’. These types of annuities pay out to your
        spouse or partner after you die but not to anyone else. A joint annuity
        stops paying when your spouse or partner dies. A guaranteed period
        annuity stops paying when the payment period you set up ends. Some of

        <p>Ask your provider the following questions:</p>

        <div class="emphasize">
          <p>What are your charges for leaving my money in longer?</p>

          <p>Do I have to take the money by a certain date and are there penalty
            charges if I don’t?</p>

          <p>How much is the pot likely to grow each year?</p>

          <p>How is the money invested and can I change this if I want?</p>

          <p>How much can I still pay in?</p>

          <p>Does my pot have any special arrangements attached to it that could
            mean I get a better deal, eg a guaranteed value at a certain
            time?</p>

          <p>Do you have up-to-date details of the person I want to leave my pot
            to (my ‘beneficiary’)?</p>

  <h2>Get a guaranteed income (annuity)</h2>

  <div class="l-grid-row">
    <div class="l-column-1">
      <p>This is an insurance policy you buy to give you a guaranteed income for
        the rest of your life or for a fixed number of years.</p>

      <p>You can take up to 25% tax free before you buy an annuity.</p>

      <p>Annuities are currently the only option which gives you a guaranteed
        income.</p>

      <p>There are different types of annuities and you have to make sure you
        buy the right one for you.</p>

      <p>If your health is poor or you have a history of smoking you can buy an
        ‘enhanced annuity’ which may pay you a better rate. Poor health and
        certain lifestyle choices can get you more money. When shopping around
        for the best rate it helps being upfront about your health. Providers
        will take this into account when calculating your rate.</p>

      <p>With pension rules changing providers are coming up with new retirement
        options. You might want to wait and see what’s available in a few years’
        time.</p>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>

        <p>If you’re interested in annuities you should:</p>

        <div class="emphasize">

          <p>Compare annuity rates:
            <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/annuities">moneyadviceservice.org.uk/annuities</a>
          </p>

          <p>Shop around for the best deal - you don’t have to stay with your
            current provider.</p>

          <p>Ask providers what types of annuity they offer and think about
            which one might be the best for you - start by searching for
            'annuity types' at
            <a href="https://www/moneyadviceservice.org.uk">moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a>
          </p>

          <p>Make sure you know how much tax you pay on your annuity income.</p>

          <p>If your health is poor, check if you can get a higher annuity
            rate.</p>

          <p>Ask your current provider if your pot has any special arrangements
            attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg a
            guaranteed annuity rate.</p>

  <h2>Take your money flexibly (take flexible lump<br/> sums or get a flexible
    income)</h2>

  <div class="l-grid-row">
    <div class="l-column-1">
      <p>There are currently 2 ways you can get a flexible income from your
        pension pot. The main differences are how you can take the tax-free part
        and what sort of income you want.</p>

      <h3>Take flexible lump sums</h3>

      <p>Your pot stays where it is and you can take money out when you want to.
        25% of each amount you take out is tax free, the rest is taxable. This
        is also known as 'uncrystallised fund pension lump sum' or 'UFPLS'.</p>

      <h3>Get a flexible income</h3>

      <p>You can take 25% of your pot as a single tax-free cash sum. The rest of
        your money is invested to give you a regular income (this is taxable).
        You use a pension provider or financial adviser to invest your money in
        a way that suits your circumstances. This is also known as 'flexi-access
        drawdown'. You can also do flexi-access drawdown in stages.</p>

      <p>If you want to do either of these you usually have to be actively
        involved in managing your money.</p>

      <p>Like with all investments the value of your pot can go up or down.</p>

      <p>You can still pay into your pot but there are restrictions. Speak to
        your provider for more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="l-column-2">
      <div class="l-text-narrow emphasize">
        <h3>Next steps</h3>

        <p>Check if your current provider offers this option and what the
          charges are - if they don’t you can transfer your pot but there might
          be charges for this.</p>

        <p>Check with your current provider if your pension pot has any special
          arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg
          a guaranteed value at a certain time</p>

        <p>Get some estimates from other providers on how much your pot could
          grow and what the charges are - usually you just have to fill in a
          short form on their website.</p>

        <p>Check with providers what products they offer to suit your
          circumstances.</p>

        <p>Make sure you know how much tax you pay on any money you’re planning
          to take out.</p>

  <h2>Take your whole pot in one go</h2>

  <div class="l-grid-row">
    <div class="l-column-1">
      <p>If you take your whole pension pot in one go - 25% is tax free and the
        remaining 75% would be taxable.</p>

      <p>Unless your pot is very small or you have more than one pot and want to
        cash in only one of them, you should think about this carefully.</p>

      <p>Once you’ve taken the money out you can’t change this decision and you
        lose any tax relief you got on these savings while they were in your
        pot.</p>

      <p>You could pay a higher amount of tax and be left with less money than
        expected. You should also consider how much income you’ll need in future
        years of retirement before you do this.</p>

  <h2>Mix your options</h2>

  <div class="l-grid-row">
    <div class="l-column-1">
      <p>You can mix your options but not all providers offer all the options
        discussed in the appointment.</p>

      <p>Usually you need a larger pension pot to do this. You might also want
        to talk to a financial adviser because mixing your options can be
        complicated. Tips on finding a financial adviser are on

      <h3>Benefits and pension income</h3>

      <p>If you’re on benefits or planning to apply for means-tested benefits in
        the
        future, any income from your pension will be taken into account. This
        could
        mean that you might not be eligible for a benefit or get less
        money. </p>

        <a href="https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk/benefits">pensionwise.gov.uk/benefits</a>
        for more information or contact your local Citizens Advice bureau.</p>

      <h3>Debt and pension income</h3>

      <p>If you’re planning to pay off large debt with money from your pension
        pot
        you should get debt advice first. If you’re worried about debt or
        budgeting
        issues the Money Advice Service and Citizens Advice can both help
        you. </p>

      <h3>Watch out for pension scams</h3>

      <p>A pension scam is when criminals try to cheat you out of the money in
        your
        pension pot. Often scammers contact you by cold calling. You should
        never
        let yourself be pressured into making a decision during a cold
        call. </p>

    <p>In the appointment we found out that you have a defined benefit or 'final

      in retirement. If you have any questions about your pension you should
      contact your provider directly. You can usually find their details on your
      pension statements.</p>

    <p>You can get help with defined benefit pensions from The Pensions Advisory
      Service. Visit their website at pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk or phone

    <p>Most people are eligible for the State Pension paid by the government.
