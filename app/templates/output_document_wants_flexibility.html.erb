    from your pot</h2>

      <p>If you want to do this you usually have to be actively involved in
        managing your money.</p>

      <p>You can:</p>

      <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon-dot icon-dot--flexi"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Take flexible lump sums from your current pot. You can do this with
        any pot size. This is also known as 'uncrystallised funds pension lump
        sum' or 'UFPLS'.
      </p>

      <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon-dot icon-dot--flexi"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Get a flexible income. You use a pension provider or financial
        adviser to invest your money in a way that gives you a regular income
        and suits your circumstances. This is also known as 'flexi-access
        drawdown'.
      </p>

      <p>Like with all investments the value of your pot can go up or down.
      </p>

      <p>You can still pay into your pot but there are restrictions. Speak to
        your provider for more information.

        <h3>Next steps</h3>

        <p>Check if your current provider offers this option and what the
          charges
          are - if they don’t you can transfer your pot but there might be
          charges
          for this.</p>

        <p>Check with your current provider if your pension pot has any special
          arrangements attached to it that could mean you get a better deal, eg
          a
          guaranteed value at a certain time.</p>

        <p>Get some estimates from other providers on how much your pot could
          grow
          and what the charges are - usually you just have to fill in a short
          form
          on their website.</p>

        <p>Check with providers what products they offer to suit your
          circumstances.</p>

        <p>Make sure you know how much tax you pay on any money you’re planning
          to
          take out.</p>
