      <p>If you use flexi-access drawdown or buy an annuity you have the choice
        of taking up to 25% of your pension pot tax free. This could provide you
        with the money you want now.</p>

      <p>However, under current pension rules you would have to do something
        with the remaining 75% within 6 months. This means you would have to put
        the money into a flexi-access drawdown fund, buy an annuity or take the
        rest of the pot as taxable cash within that time.</p>

      <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon-dot icon-dot--flexi"></div>
      </div>
      <p>You can also take flexible lump sums and get 25% of each cash amount
        tax free (‘uncrystallised fund pension lump sum’ or ‘UFPLS’).</p>

      <div class="icon-container">
        <div class="icon-dot icon-dot--whole"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Alternatively, you could cash in your whole pot in one go. Unless your
        pot is very small or you have more than one pot and want to cash in only
        one of them, you should think about this carefully.</p>

      <p>You could pay a higher amount of tax and be left with less money than
        expected. You should also consider how much income you’ll need in future
        years of retirement before you do this.</p>
