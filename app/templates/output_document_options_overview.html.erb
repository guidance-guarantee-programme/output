      <h3 class="options-summary">Leave your pot untouched</h3>

      <p>You don’t have to take money from your pension straight away. You can
        leave your money invested and take it when you’re ready. You might have
        a bigger choice of pension products in the future as providers are
        coming up with new ones.</p>

      </div>
      <h3 class="options-summary">Get a guaranteed income <span class="normal">(annuity)</span></h3>

      <p>This is an insurance policy you buy to give you a guaranteed income for
        the rest of your life or for a fixed number of years. You can take up
        to 25% of your pot tax free before you buy an annuity. There are
        different types of annuities and it’s important you buy the right one
        for you.</p>

      </div>
      <h3 class="options-summary">Take your money flexibly <span class="normal">
        (take flexible lump sums or get a flexible income)</span></h3>

      <p>You can take your money flexibly in 2 ways. It depends what kind of
        income you want to get from your pot. You can always take 25% tax
        free.</p>

      <p><b>Take flexible lump sums:</b><br />
        Your pot stays where it is and you can
        take money out when you want to. 25% of each cash amount you take out is
        tax free, the rest is taxable. This is also known as 'uncrystallised
        fund pension lump sum' or ‘UFPLS’.</p>

      <p><b>Get a flexible income:</b><br />
        You can take 25% of your pot as a single
        tax-free cash sum. The rest of your money is invested to give you a
        regular income (this is taxable). You use a pension provider or
        financial adviser to invest your money in a way that suits your
        circumstances. This is also known as 'flexi-access drawdown'. You can
        also do flexi-access drawdown in stages.</p>

      <p>If you take your whole pension pot in one go 25% is tax-free and the
        remaining 75% is taxable.</p>

        the options we talked about in the appointment.</p>
